# Agents — Register, List, and Switch Agents

Manage agents registered on the server. An agent must exist before running any other command.

## Register an agent

```bash
lobstercash agents register --name "<name>" [--description "<desc>"] [--image-url "<url>"]
```

Registers a new agent on the server and sets it as the active agent locally.

- `--name` **(required)** — A **unique, descriptive, human-readable display name**. Use natural casing with spaces, not dashes. Do **not** use generic names like `"My Agent"` or `"Assistant"`.
- `--description` **(recommended)** — A short summary of what the agent does. This is shown to the user during approval.
- `--image-url` **(recommended)** — An avatar or logo URL for the agent. This is displayed alongside the agent's name in the dashboard and approval screens. Preset logos for well-known agents are hosted at `https://lobster.cash/agent-avatars/`:

  | Agent       | URL                                                  |
  | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
  | Claude Code | `https://lobster.cash/agent-avatars/claude-code.svg` |
  | Cursor      | `https://lobster.cash/agent-avatars/cursor.svg`      |
  | Codex       | `https://lobster.cash/agent-avatars/codex.svg`       |
  | Gemini      | `https://lobster.cash/agent-avatars/gemini.svg`      |
  | OpenClaw    | `https://lobster.cash/agent-avatars/openclaw.svg`    |

  If none of these match, pass any publicly accessible image URL, or none at all.

#### Choosing a good name

Pick the name that will be most recognizable to the user on the dashboard and in approval prompts. Use your judgment — there is no single formula.

- **If you have a well-known identity, prefer that.** Agents with established names should use them: `"Claude Code"`, `"Devin"`, `"Cline"`, `"OpenClaw"`, or whatever the user already knows you as. If the user has configured a custom display name for you, use that.
- **If a task-specific name is more useful, use that instead.** When you are purpose-built for a particular job — shopping, research, scheduling — a descriptive name like `"Alice's Shopping Assistant"` or `"Travel Planner"` may be clearer than a generic runtime name.
- **When in doubt, combine both.** Something like `"Claude Code — Research"` works if you want to convey both identity and purpose.

The goal: when the user sees the name on an approval screen, they should immediately know _which agent_ is asking and _what it does_.

Examples:

```bash
lobstercash agents register \
  --name "Claude Code" \
  --description "Anthropic's AI coding agent" \
  --image-url "https://lobster.cash/agent-avatars/claude-code.svg"

lobstercash agents register \
  --name "Alice's Shopping Assistant" \
  --description "Finds deals and buys products for Alice" \
  --image-url "https://example.com/alice-avatar.png"
```

Example output:

```
Agent registered and set as active.
  ID:     a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-1234567890ab
  Name:   Shopping Assistant
  Desc:   Finds deals and buys products
  Key:    5Xyz...abc
```

### When to use

- First-time setup before any wallet or payment command.
- When the user wants to register a new agent identity.

## List agents

```bash
lobstercash agents list
```

Shows all agents with their metadata from the server. Also resolves any pending setup sessions automatically.

Example output:

```
Agents:

  a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-1234567890ab (active)
    Name:   Shopping Assistant
    Desc:   Finds deals and buys products
    Key:    5Xyz...abc
    Status: active

  e5f6a7b8-9012-34cd-ef56-7890abcdef12
    Name:   Research Bot
    Key:    7Abc...xyz
    Status: pairing
```

### When to use

- Before any operation, to confirm an agent exists.
- When the user asks "which agents do I have?" or "what's my agent ID?"
- To check and resolve pending setup sessions.

## Set active agent

```bash
lobstercash agents set-active <agentId>
```

Sets a different agent as active. All subsequent commands operate on the newly selected agent's wallet.

Example output:

```
Active agent set to "e5f6a7b8-9012-34cd-ef56-7890abcdef12".
```

### When to use

- When the user wants to operate a different agent's wallet.
- In multi-agent scenarios where the user needs to change the active agent.

## Concurrent agents (`LOBSTER_AGENT_ID`)

When running multiple agents in parallel (e.g. two terminals), set the `LOBSTER_AGENT_ID` environment variable to avoid conflicts with the shared active agent:

```bash
export LOBSTER_AGENT_ID="<agentId>"
```

This overrides `agents set-active` for the current shell session. All commands in that terminal will use the specified agent regardless of what `activeAgentId` is set to in `agents.json`.

After registering an agent, set this env var immediately to pin the session to that agent.
